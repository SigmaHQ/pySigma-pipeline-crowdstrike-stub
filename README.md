# pySigma CrowdStrike Legacy Pipeline Placeholder

## Description

This is a placeholder for the legacy *pySigma-pipeline-crowdstrike* project that
was replaced with
[pySigma-backend-crowdstrike](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma-backend-crowdstrike).
The legacy pipeline project was
 discontinued because it was extended with a
LogScale backend. The pipeline `crowdstrike_fdr` formerly contained in this
project was extended and is available under the same name as in the legacy
project.

## Migration

Replace all occurrences of the package `pysigma-pipeline-crowdstrike` with `pysigma-backend-crowdstrike`.
